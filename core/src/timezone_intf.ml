  (** [local] is the machine's local timezone, as determined from the [TZ] environment
      variable or the [/etc/localtime] file. It is computed from the state of the process
      environment and on-disk tzdata database at some unspecified moment prior to its
      first use, so its value may be unpredictable if that state changes during program
      operation. Arguably, changing the timezone of a running program is a problematic
      operation anyway -- most people write code assuming the clock doesn't suddenly jump
      several hours without warning.

      Note that any function using this timezone can throw an exception if the [TZ]
      environment variable is misconfigured or if the appropriate timezone files can't be
      found because of the way the box is configured. We don't sprinkle [_exn] all over
      all the names in this module because such misconfiguration is quite rare. *)

module type Timezone = sig @@ portable
  (** Timezone handles parsing timezone data and create [Timezone.t] that can later be
      used to manipulate time using the [Time_float] and [Time_ns] modules.

      Timezone is currently only able to read the Timezone Database provided by
      {{:https://www.iana.org/time-zones} IANA}. It should work out of the box on Linux
      and macOS.

      {2 Where are the timezone data located ?}

      The location of the timezone files can be set using the environment variable
      [TZDIR]. If not set, [Timezone] will fallback to [/usr/share/zoneinfo/].

      {2 What is the local timezone ?}

      The local timezone can be set using the environment variable [TZ]. If not set,
      [Timezone] will fallback to [/etc/localtime]. In a JavaScript context, we
      automatically set the environment variable [TZ] to
      [Intl.DateTimeFormat().resolvedOptions().timeZone].

      {2 Compatibility with JavaScript.}

      The [Timezone] library can be used when constructing JavaScript applications with
      {{:https://github.com/ocsigen/js_of_ocaml/} Js_of_ocaml}.

      In the past, web browsers needed to be provided with a copy of the timezone
      database, but this is no longer required. *)
