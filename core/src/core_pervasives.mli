    Functions here are in one of four states:
    1. Deprecated using [@@deprecated].
    2. Accepted as part of Core for the forseeable future.

    between functional values raises [Invalid_argument]. Comparison between cyclic
    structures may not terminate. *)

(** [compare x y] returns [0] if [x] is equal to [y], a negative integer if [x] is less
    than [y], and a positive integer if [x] is greater than [y]. The ordering implemented
    by [compare] is compatible with the comparison predicates [=], [<] and [>] defined
    above, with one difference on the treatment of the float value {!Caml.nan}. Namely,
    the comparison predicates treat [nan] as different from any other float value,
    including itself; while [compare] treats [nan] as equal to itself and less than any
    other float value. This treatment of [nan] ensures that [compare] defines a total
    ordering relation.

    [compare] applied to functional values may raise [Invalid_argument]. [compare] applied
    to cyclic structures may not terminate.

    The [compare] function can be used as the comparison function required by the
    {!Set.Make} and {!Map.Make} functors, as well as the {!List.sort} and {!Array.sort}

    [e1] also affects [e2]. On non-mutable types, the behavior of [( == )] is

    OCaml's floating-point numbers follow the IEEE 754 standard, using double precision
    (64 bits) numbers. Floating-point operations never raise an exception on overflow,
    underflow, division by zero, etc. Instead, special IEEE numbers are returned as
    appropriate, such as [infinity] for [1.0 /. 0.0], [neg_infinity] for [-1.0 /. 0.0],
    and [nan] ('not a number') for [0.0 /. 0.0]. These special numbers then propagate
    through floating-point computations as expected: for instance, [1.0 /. infinity] is
    [0.0], and any arithmetic operation with [nan] as argument returns [nan] as result. *)

(** {6 Operations on format strings} *)

(** Format strings are character strings with special lexical conventions that defines the
    functionality of formatted input/output functions. Format strings are used to read
    data with formatted input functions from module {!Scanf} and to print data with
    formatted output functions from modules {!Printf} and {!Format}.

    Format strings are made of three kinds of entities:
    - {e conversions specifications}, introduced by the special character ['%'] followed
      by one or more characters specifying what kind of argument to read or print,
    - {e formatting indications}, introduced by the special character ['@'] followed by
      one or more characters specifying how to read or print the argument,
    - {e plain characters} that are regular characters with usual lexical conventions.
      Plain characters specify string literals to be read in the input or printed in the
      output.

    There is an additional lexical rule to escape the special characters ['%'] and ['@']
    in format strings: if a special character follows a ['%'] character, it is treated as
    a plain character. In other words, ["%%"] is considered as a plain ['%'] and ["%@"] as
    a plain ['@'].

    For more information about conversion specifications and formatting indications
    available, read the documentation of modules {!Scanf}, {!Printf} and {!Format}. *)

(** Format strings have a general and highly polymorphic type
    [('a, 'b, 'c, 'd, 'e, 'f) format6]. The two simplified types, [format] and [format4]
    below are included for backward compatibility with earlier releases of OCaml.

    The meaning of format string type parameters is as follows:

    - ['a] is the type of the parameters of the format for formatted output functions
      ([printf]-style functions); ['a] is the type of the values read by the format for
      formatted input functions ([scanf]-style functions).

    - ['b] is the type of input source for formatted input functions and the type of
      output target for formatted output functions. For [printf]-style functions from
      module [Printf], ['b] is typically [out_channel]; for [printf]-style functions from
      module [Format], ['b] is typically [Format.formatter]; for [scanf]-style functions
      from module [Scanf], ['b] is typically [Scanf.Scanning.in_channel].

    Type argument ['b] is also the type of the first argument given to user's defined
    printing functions for [%a] and [%t] conversions, and user's defined reading functions
    for [%r] conversion.

    - ['c] is the type of the result of the [%a] and [%t] printing functions, and also the
      type of the argument transmitted to the first argument of [kprintf]-style functions
      or to the [kscanf]-style functions.

    - ['d] is the type of parameters for the [scanf]-style functions.

    - ['e] is the type of the receiver function for the [scanf]-style functions.

    - ['f] is the final result type of a formatted input/output function invocation: for
      the [printf]-style functions, it is typically [unit]; for the [scanf]-style
      functions, it is typically the result type of the receiver function. *)

(** [f1 ^^ f2] catenates format strings [f1] and [f2]. The result is a format string that
    behaves as the concatenation of format strings [f1] and [f2]: in case of formatted
    output, it accepts arguments from [f1], then arguments from [f2]; in case of formatted

(** Terminate the process, returning the given status code to the operating system:
    usually 0 to indicate no errors, and a small positive integer to indicate failure. All
    open output channels are flushed with [flush_all]. An implicit [exit 0] is performed
    each time a program terminates normally. An implicit [exit 2] is performed if the
    program terminates early because of an uncaught exception. *)

    registered with [at_exit] will be called when the program executes {!Caml.exit}, or
    terminates, either normally or because of an uncaught exception. The functions are
    called in 'last in, first out' order: the function most recently added with [at_exit]
    is called first. *)
