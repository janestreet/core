(** Imperative set-like data structure.

    There are a few differences from simple sets:

    - Duplicates are allowed.
    - It doesn't require anything (hashable, comparable) of elements in the bag.
    - Addition and removal are constant time operations.

    It is an error to modify a bag ([add], [remove], [remove_one], ...) during iteration
    ([fold], [iter], ...). *)
