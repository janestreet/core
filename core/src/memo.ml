(* We expect [f_onestep] to be a one-step unrolled recursive function; see the mli. Hence,
   here we create the memoized function _and_ pass it to [f_onestep] to be used for
   recursive calls.

   Note that we immediately apply [f_onestep] to its first argument here so that any
   precomputation is performed when the user calls [recursive].

   As an example, if someone writes this non-memoized code:

   [ let rec f = let data = compute_without_using_f () in fun x -> ... f ... ]

   and converts to memoization by doing:

   {[
     let f =
       let f_onestep f = let data = compute_without_using_f () in fun x -> ... f ... in
       recursive f_onestep
   ]}

   we want to compute [data] immediately. If we had [fun x -> f_onestep (force memoized)
   x] below, we'd recompute [data] each time the user calls [f] on an argument that hadn't
   yet been memoized. *)
