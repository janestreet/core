(** Imperative data structure for representing disjoint sets.

    Union find is used to implement an equivalence relation on objects, where the
    equivalence relation can dynamically be coarsened by "union"ing two equivalence
    classes together.

    All of the operations are effectively (amortized) constant time.

    See {{:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disjoint-set_data_structure} Wikipedia}.

    This implementation is not thread-safe. *)

    already equal, then nothing changes). The value of the combined class is the value of
