(** The internal time representation of [Zone.t]. This is a tiny subset of [Time0_intf.S],
    see that interface for details such as the meaning of [Span] and [Date_and_ofday].

    The name of the interface reflects the fact that the interface only gives you access
    to the seconds of the [t]. But you can use this interface with types that have higher
    precision than that, hence the rounding implied in the name of
    [to_int63_seconds_round_down_exn]. *)

  (** The type of a time-zone.

      bin_io and sexp representations of Zone.t are the name of the zone, and not the full

      reconstructed on the receiving/reading side by reloading the zone file from disk.

      representations. *)

      only, and cannot reliably be turned back into a [t]. This function reads and writes

      The [_exn] accessors raise if there is no such transition. These accessors are split
      up to increase performance and improve allocation; they are intended as a low-level
      back-end for commonly-used time conversion functions. See [Time.Zone] and
      [Time_ns.Zone] for higher-level accessors that return an optional tuple for clock
      shifts in either direction. *)
