    As with [Error.create], [sexp_of_a a] is lazily computed when the error is converted
    to a sexp. So if [a] is mutated in the time between the call to [failwiths] and the
    sexp conversion, those mutations will be reflected in the error message. Use
    [~strict:()] to force [sexp_of_a a] to be computed immediately.

    In this signature we write [~here:Lexing.position] rather than
    [~here:Source_code_position.t] to avoid a circular dependency. *)
