(** This module can be used to safely expose functions and values in signatures that
    should only be used in unit tests.

    Under the hood, ['a t = 'a Lazy.t] and the only thing that ever forces them is the
    [force] function below which should only be called in unit tests.

    For example, suppose in some module, [type t] is actually an [int]. You want to keep
    the type definition opaque, but use the underlying representation in unit tests. You
    could write in the ml:

    {[
      let test_to_int t = Only_in_test.return t
      let test_of_int n = Only_in_test.return n
    ]}

    You would then expose in the mli:

    {[
      type t

      val test_to_int : t -> int Only_in_test.t
      val test_of_int : int -> t Only_in_test.t
    ]}

    Finally, if you have specific values that you might want to use in unit tests, but
    that have top-level side-effects or take too long to compute, you can delay the
    side-effects or computation until the unit tests are run by writing, e.g.:

    [let (test_special_value : t Only_in_test.t) = Only_in_test.of_thunk (fun () ->  factorial 100)]

    instead of

    [let (test_special_value : t Only_in_test.t) = Only_in_test.return (factorial 100)] *)
