  (** Time of day.

      [t] represents a clock-face time of day. Usually this is equivalent to a time-offset
      from midnight, and each [t] occurs exactly once in each calendar day. However, when
      daylight saving time begins or ends, some clock face times (and therefore [t]'s) can
      occur more than once per day or not at all, and e.g. 04:00 can occur three or five
      hours after midnight, so knowing your current offset from midnight is *not* in
      general equivalent to knowing the current [t].

      (See {!Zone} for tools to help you cope with DST.)

      There is one nonstandard representable value, [start_of_next_day], which can be
      thought of as "24:00:00" in 24-hour time. It is essentially "00:00:00" on the next
      day. By having this value, we allow comparisons against a strict upper bound on [t]
      values. However, it has some odd properties; for example,
      [Time.of_date_ofday ~zone date start_of_next_day |> Time.to_date ~zone] yields a
      different date.

      Any [ofday] will satisfy [start_of_day <= ofday <= start_of_next_day]. *)
