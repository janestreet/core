(** Extensible string buffers based on Bigstrings.

    This module implements string buffers that automatically expand as necessary. It
    provides accumulative concatenation of strings in quasi-linear time (instead of
    quadratic time when strings are concatenated pairwise).

    This implementation uses Bigstrings instead of strings. This removes the 16MB limit on
    buffer size (on 32-bit machines), and improves I/O-performance when reading/writing
    from/to channels. *)

(** Return a copy of the current contents of the buffer as a bigstring. The buffer itself
    is unchanged. *)
val big_contents : t -> Bigstring.t

(** Return the actual underlying bigstring used by this bigbuffer. No copying is involved.
    To be safe, use and finish with the returned value before calling any other function
    in this module on the same [Bigbuffer.t]. *)
val volatile_contents : t -> Bigstring.t

(** [add_bigstring b s] appends the bigstring [s] at the end of the buffer [b]. *)
val add_bigstring : t -> Bigstring.t -> unit

(** [add_bin_prot b writer x] appends the bin-protted representation of [x] at the end of
    the buffer [b]. *)
val add_bin_prot : t -> 'a Bin_prot.Type_class.writer -> 'a -> unit

(** [add_bin_prot_local b ~bin_write ~bin_size x] appends the bin-protted representation
    of local [x] at the end of the buffer [b]. *)
val add_bin_prot_local
  :  t
  -> bin_write:'a Bin_prot.Write.writer__local
  -> bin_size:'a Bin_prot.Size.sizer__local
  -> 'a @ local
  -> unit

(** [add_substitute b f s] appends the string pattern [s] at the end of the buffer [b]
    with substitution. The substitution process looks for variables into the pattern and
    substitutes each variable name by its value, as obtained by applying the mapping [f]
    to the variable name. Inside the string pattern, a variable name immediately follows a
    non-escaped [$] character and is one of the following:
    - a non empty sequence of alphanumeric or [_] characters,
    - an arbitrary sequence of characters enclosed by a pair of matching parentheses or
      curly brackets.

    An escaped [$] character is a [$] that immediately follows a backslash character; it
    then stands for a plain [$]. Raise [Caml.Not_found] or [Not_found_s] if the closing
    character of a parenthesized variable cannot be found. *)
